        <h4>Love by Design</h4>
          <p>Ray Kaiser and Charles Eames met in 1940 while at art school in Michigan. Eames fell in love with the dark-eyed, curious painter deeply and suddenly, and pursued her despite his marriage and the recent birth of a daughter. At the end of an exasperated courtship, Eames’s final request came in a letter. “I am 34 (almost) years old, single (again), and broke. I love you very much and would like to marry you very soon.” To this last attempt, Kaiser said yes.
        </p>

        <p>The new couple set up home and shop in an apartment in Los Angeles. Their single-minded focus was learning from Charles’s prize-winning plywood chair, created with architect Eero Saarinen for a MoMA competition in 1940, and moving beyond art and into the realm of mass consumerism via new production methods. Exhaustive efforts finally led to its commercial success–with couches and furniture lines quickly following—and Eames became a household name. Emboldened by financial success, Charles and Ray went to work in a massive studio-cum-workshop in Venice, California, where his blueprints interchanged with miniature movie sets, stacks of Ray’s notes written on cigarette pack linings, and thousands of photos.</p>

      <h4>Collaboration</h4>
      <p>From furniture to large-scale architecture projects, such as the IBM Pavilion for the 1964-1965 New York
        World’s Fair, Ray and Charles pushed creative limits by means of an unspoken bond and a playful aesthetic. The
        running joke remained that Charles was an architect who never finished architecture school, while Ray was a
        painter who never painted. In reality, every space was a canvas for Ray. While she took Charles’s projects
        beyond the limitations of black and white, he brought a constant stream of ideas to her work.</p>

      <h4>Life with Charles Eames</h4>
      <p>No place more embodied their collaboration than the couple’s Pacific Palisades home, built in 1949 as an entry
        in an architecture competition sponsored by Arts and Architecture magazine (for which Ray designed several
        covers). A secluded escape made of pre-fabricated pieces, with seventeen-foot-high ceilings, a glass and steel
        exterior, and Hans Hofman canvases suspended from the ceiling, the house proved an ideal setting for Vogue photo
        shoots—such as a 1954 story featuring a model lounging on stacked floor mats—and dinner parties that ran late
        into the night and showcased Ray’s quirky commitment to aesthetics above all else (for dessert she once placed
        bouquets of flowers in front of flabbergasted guests in lieu of cookies and cake).</p>

        marriage and the recent birth of a daughter. At the end of an exasperated courtship, Eames’s final request came

        “Dear Miss Kaiser, I am 34 (almost) years old, single (again) and broke. I love you very much and would like to
        marry you very very soon.* I cannot promise to support us very well. — but if given the chance I’ll sure in hell
        try –

        *soon means very soon.

        What is the size of this finger??

        As soon as I get to that hospital I will write “reams” well little ones.

        love xxxxxxxxxx

        Charlie”

        To this last attempt, Kaiser said yes.

      <h4>Recognition</h4>

      <p>RBehind the aesthetic stood an equally stylish couple: Charles and Ray Eames, whose artistic partnership shook
        up both the world of design and the conventional notion of romantic collaboration.
        In a 1972 short film titled “Design Q&A,” Charles Eames offered answers to a series of questions about design, a
        field in which he and his wife, Ray, had envisioned everything from medical splints and airport seating to
        low-cost housing and children’s toys.

        “What is your definition of design, Monsieur Eames?” asked the interviewer, Madame L’Amic.

        “One could describe design as a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a particular purpose,” Charles
        replied.

        This Eamesian understanding of design as a solution rather than a luxury – as something that’s about industry as
        much as art – encapsulates the unique philosophy and vast influence of Charles and Ray Eames, a husband-and-wife
        team whose lightness of touch and Californian joy of living infuses contemporary offices and homes.

        }
      </style>
      <p>Their belief that everyday objects can both define and provide meaning makes them one of the most enduring
        creative forces of the 20th century. They predicted the future even if they couldn’t describe it.

        After a life together Charles died on August 21, 1978. After that, Ray completed all the projects they had
        started together before hanging up her design hat and devoting her life to communicating the couple’s theories
        and practices via talks and writing. She died on 21 August 1988, the ten-year anniversary of her beloved
        husband’s death.
