        <h4>Early life</h4>
          <p>Ray-Bernice Alexandra Kaiser Eames (née Kaiser; December 15, 1912 – August 21, 1988) was an American artist and designer who worked in a variety of media. In creative partnership with her husband Charles Eames and the Eames Office, she was responsible for groundbreaking contributions in the fields of architecture, graphic design, textile design, film, and furniture. The Eames Office is most famous for its furniture, which is still being made today. Together, the Eameses are considered one of the most influential creative forces of the twentieth century.

          During her lifetime, Ray Kaiser Eames was given notably less credit than she has been given posthumously in art and design literature, museum shows, and documentaries.
        </p>
        <p>Ray Eames was born in Sacramento, California to Alexander and Edna Burr Kaiser, and had an older brother named Maurice. Edna was Episcopalian and Alexander was raised Jewish but did not practice; Ray and Maurice were raised as Episcopalians. Eames was known to her family as Ray Ray. Eames' father managed a vaudeville theatre, the Empress Theater (now the Crest Theatre), in Sacramento until 1920, when he became an insurance salesman, later owning a downtown office to better support his family.

          The family lived in an apartment for much of Ray's early childhood and moved to a bungalow outside of town. Her parents taught her to value objects which induce joy which later led to inventions in furniture design and toys. Her parents also instilled the value of enjoyment of nature.</p>

        }
      </style>
      <h4>Education</h4>
      <p>Ray Eames graduated from Sacramento High School in February 1931. She was a member of the Art Club, the Big
        Sister Club, and was on the decorating committee for the senior dance.

        In 1933, Kaiser graduated from the May Friend Bennett Women's College in Millbrook, New York (where her art
        teacher was Lu Duble), and moved to New York City to study abstract expressionist painting with Duble's mentor,
        Hans Hofmann.</p>
      <p>
        In the 1930s, Kaiser’s artistic career centered around her painting. In 1936, Kaiser became a founding member of
        the American Abstract Artists (AAA) group and displayed paintings in their first show in 1937 at Riverside
        Museum in Manhattan. The AAA group promoted abstract art at a time when major galleries refused to show it. She
        was a key figure in the New York art scene at that time and was friends with Lee Krasner and Mercedes Matter,
        who were important figures in abstract expressionism. Kaiser has a painting in the permanent collection of The
        Whitney Museum of American Art. Little remains of her art from this period as it was lost.

        Kaiser lived alone in New York City until she left the Hoffman Studio to return home to care for her ailing
        mother. Edna died in 1940.</p>

        }
      </style>

      <h4>Life with Charles Eames</h4>
      <p>It was also at Cranbrook where Kaiser met her husband-to-be, Charles Eames, who was the head of the department
        of industrial design there. Charles Eames was married at the time, with one child, but soon divorced his first
        wife. Charles and Ray were married in 1941, and Ray changed her name from Kaiser to Eames

        Settling in Los Angeles, California, Ray and Charles Eames began a highly successful and lauded career in design
        and architecture.</p>

        }
      </style>
      <h4> Later years</h4>
      <p>The Eames Office's productivity slowed after the death of Charles Eames in August 1978. Ray Eames worked on
        several unfinished projects (e.g. a German version of the Mathematica exhibition), was a consultant to IBM,
        published books, gave lectures, accepted awards, and administered the Eames archive and estate.Approximately 1.5
        million two-dimensional objects were organized and donated by Ray to the Library of Congress for archival
        safekeeping. She authored a book featuring all Eames Office projects from 1941 until the mid-80s, although much
        of it was altered before publication (just after Ray's death). In the years before her death Ray hosted visiting
        student groups, numbering in the region of fifty to sixty, and was planning to host one hundred members of the
        American Institute of Architects to view the house and picnic in the meadow.</p>

      <h4>Legacy</h4>
      <p>In celebration of what would have been Ray's 100th birthday, Vitra renamed a street at its Basel Campus
        "Ray-Eames-Strasse 1" in her honor.

        On February 23, 2013 a 3,300-square-foot exhibition titled “Ray Eames: A Century of Modern Design,” opened in
        the Sacramento, California Museum. The exhibition ran for one year and featured work produced by Ray before she
        met Charles in 1941 in addition to the work of The Eames Office.

        Eames along with her partner Charles Eames, prepared the India Report, based on which the Government of India
        set up the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, India.</p>

      <h4>Recognition</h4>

      <p>Ray Eames' contributions to the work of the Eames Office were severely overlooked during her lifetime.This
        often included actively stating that Ray was a hardly significant part of the Eames Office. When the Eameses
        were on The Today Show in 1956, the chair in question was “designed by Charles Eames,” not by Ray and Charles.
        The host of the show, Arlene Francis, then stated that “when there is a very successful man there is an
        interesting and able woman behind him.” Then, Francis introduced Ray, saying “This is Mrs. Eames, and she’s
        going to tell us how she helps Charles.” The media almost always stated that the work was Charles’, sometimes
        footnoting Ray.

        In the past few decades, however, Ray's work has been given more attention. In 1990, the journal Furniture
        History published a thorough interview between design historian Pat Kirkham and Ray Eames. In the introduction
        to the interview transcript, Kirkham wrote that "in the case of Charles and Ray Eames, the interchange of ideas
        between these two enormously talented individuals is particularly difficult to chart because their personal and
        design relationship was so close." Charles Eames was consistent in stating that Ray's role was imperative to the
        work the two did together.

        Ray Eames has also received posthumous recognition for her personal fashion sense, which the New York Times
        described as "too maidenly to be echt-bohemian, too saucy to be quaint."</p>
