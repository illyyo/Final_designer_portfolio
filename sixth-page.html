        style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        Strolling up the drive to Charles and Ray Eameses’ now-iconic 1949 residence in Pacific Palisades, California,
        is like stepping into another world—a tree-lined, flower-filled sanctuary that’s far removed from the city
        streets below. If it’s a cool morning, mist will roll in from the Pacific and hover above the ocean-side bluff
        where the house resides. With that mist comes the tang of sea salt, mingling with the scent of eucalyptus and
        wafting through the copse of over 200 trees that populate the surrounding meadow.
      </p>

      <p
        style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        The home itself is like something out of a dream—or, rather, Charles and Ray’s playful yet pragmatic minds. The
        pair devised the house as part of Arts & Architecture magazine’s Case Study House Program, which challenged
        architects to design homes that reflected life in the modern world using techniques and materials developed
        during World War II. In a design brief published in the December 1945 issue, Charles wrote that the home, “in
        its free relation to the ground, the trees, the sea—with constant proximity to the whole vast order of
        nature—acts as reorientor and ‘shock-absorber’ and should provide the needed relaxations from the daily
        complications arising within problems.”

      <p
        style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        The result, Case Study House No. 8, is a modernist masterpiece. The residence and studio, dual steel boxes
        nestled into the bluff, are exclusively comprised of off-the-shelf materials: black-painted steel beams and
        glass panels interspersed with rectangles of white, gold, orange-red, and blue. Placed behind a row of
        eucalyptus trees, the home’s precise, geometric shapes and engineered materials integrate effortlessly with the
        natural world. The structures live lightly on the land, taking advantage of the trees’ shade and beauty without
        encroaching on them.
      </p>

      <p
        style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        The magic of the Eames House and landscape has fared well since Ray passed away in 1988. After her death,
        Charles and Ray’s daughter, Lucia Eames, maintained the home with support from founding sponsors including the
        Eames Office, Herman Miller, and Vitra. Today, the Eames Foundation is responsible for its care and operations.
        Over the years, the Foundation has worked with several organizations as part of its 250 Year Project—the
        Foundation’s plan for ensuring that future generations visiting the house may enjoy the same authentic
        experience as people do today.

          style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
          “To succeed with the 250 Year Project, we need to approach the conservation of the Eames House with a plan
          that balances the differing needs of the structures, objects, and landscape, while still showing how Charles
          and Ray lived and worked there,” says Lucia Dewey Atwood, granddaughter of Charles and Ray and Director of the
          Eames Foundation 250 Year Project. “We need to anticipate repairs. Think about the possible solutions for
          replacing the roof. If you are looking at things from a 250-year perspective, it’s quite likely you’ll make
          different decisions than you would looking at them in a 20-year context.”
        </p>

        <p
          style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
          In 2011, the Eames Foundation loaned the contents of the living room to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
          for a temporary exhibit. This gave the Eames Foundation the opportunity to work with Escher GuneWardena
          Architecture (EGA) and the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) to conduct research and implement the best
          methods for addressing urgent deterioration issues.

        <p
          style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
          Says architect Ravi GuneWardena, who has preserved and renovated homes by other mid-century architects like
          Richard Neutra, A. Quincy Jones, and John Lautner: “Each of these houses have very specific characteristics
          that have to be studied and dealt with uniquely. What is essential, however, is developing a system for
          researching all materials available for each house, deciphering the architectural intent of the original
          authors, and documenting every step in the conservation process so that someone can follow your methodology in
          the future.”
        </p>

        <p
          style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
          That’s exactly the approach EGA, GCI, and the Eames Foundation have taken since the beginning of the
          conservation project, when they replaced damaged floor tiles, made repairs to the home’s steel structure, and
          worked with engineering firm Wiss, Janney, and Elstner Associates to replace the roof.
        </p>

        <p
          style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
          The preservation work extends to the landscape too. To maintain its health, every few years the Foundation
          prunes and occasionally fells several eucalyptus trees. To replace them, the Eames Foundation encourages
          volunteer seedlings to grow and plans to plant more trees in the future.

            <h4>Charles and Ray's Design Home</h4>
            <p>Charles died in 1978; his wife and professional partner passed away 10 years later. But they are
              remembered for their creative use of materials and innovative design of architecture, furniture and
              industrial products.
            </p>
            <p>His ultimate goal was for architects to create beautiful homes for modern life using only “off-the-shelf”
              materials that could be ordered directly through steel fabricator catalogs.

              The design for the Eames House started out as a collaboration between Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen.
              Their entry’s main architectural feature was a raised steel and glass box that cantilevered over the front
              lawn to give residents an ocean view, and they aptly named it The Bridge House.

            <h4>Iconic Spaces: The Eames House</h4>
            <p>Originally known as Case Study House #8, The Eames House was initially created as one of a series of
              homes in a 1945 architectural competition. The contest, The Case Study House Program, was started by John
              Entenza, who at the time was the publisher of the popular Arts & Architecture magazine. </p>
            <p>In collaboration with the Eames Office and Dutch designer Hella Jongerius, a carefully defined new colour
              scheme was chosen to give the EDU a fresh and contemporary look while still celebrating the spirit of the
              1940s and '50s. With its eye-catching combination of coloured panels, the EDU desk adds a cheerful and
              inviting accent to the home office. The panels also function as a modesty shield and partially enclose the
              two storage compartments. The metal support frame is height-adjustable to accommodate uneven floors.</p>

            <p>However, due to WWII, it took a full three years for the materials to arrive. By that time, both Charles
              and Ray Eames had grown attached to the site originally planned for the Bridge House, and wanted the home
              to have little to no impact on the land surrounding it.

              And so, Charles and Ray took the project on together and reformatted the home to suit this change using
              the same materials. In doing so, they changed the name to The Eames House. </p>
            <p>
              Since part of the competition was allowing the architects to choose their client for this project, Charles
              and Ray fittingly suggested that their house be for a married couple working in design and whose grown
              children were no longer around.

            </p>
            <p>Their final design was of two separate steel and glass structures with a small courtyard in between – a
              living space and a work space. This new design ended up being considered the most successful home in the
              competition both in terms of a comfortable living space and an architectural marvel. Charles and Ray moved
              into the Eames House on Christmas Eve, 1949, and both lived there for the rest of their lives.</p>

            <p>In 2004, years after both Eameses had passed away, The Eames Foundation was created in order to preserve
              and protect The Eames House as well as the legacy of Charles and Ray Eames. Today, the house is largely
              untouched and the studio is used gently as a workspace by The Eames Foundation. In 2006, the building was
              designated a National Historic Landmark.
