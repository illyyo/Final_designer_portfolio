        Originally designed in 1948, the Eames La Chaise was a conceptual free-form & organically designed daybed on
        which a user could either sit or lie. With an almost Dali-esque appearance, the inspiration for the piece
        actually came from the sculpture 'The Floating Figure' by Gaston Lachaise, hence the origins of the name.
        Although intended to be released in 1950, Herman Miller found the piece to be too costly and never released one.
      </p>

      <p
        style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        It would take over 40 years before the Eames La Chaise would actually be put into production. This would happen
        in 1991 when the first market pieces rolled off the production line of Vitra, the European licensee. It means
        therefore that the 'La Chaise' was a design that was not part of the portfolio of Charles and Ray Eames during
        their lifetime. Vitra later reproduced a few of the early Eames designs that were not released including La
        Chaise and the Plywood Elephant. Although the Wiki is designed to showcase the works of Charles and Ray
        available in their lifetime, the Eames La Chaise is included as it is known around the world, has a great
        history and is a faithful reproduction of the concept.

      <p
        style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        The Eames La Chaise design was actually a concept entered into the 'International Competition For Low Cost
        Furniture' held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1948. It did not win as was deemed too large but did
        get special mention for its form. In truth the competition was more important for Charles Eames as the beginning
        of the development for the fiberglass side and arm chairs, even though they did start life in aluminum.
      </p>

      <p
        style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
        The Eames La Chaise was initially released in 1991 sympathetic to the original design before changing to use
        polyurethane in 2001.

    <h4>Ray's Office</h4>
      <p>True to the Eames philosophy, all of the materials were presented honestly: the extruded steel structure was unadorned and unconcealed. There were optional metal parts: cross wires and sheets of steel drilled with holes. A type of thin plywood door that Charles and Ray had first developed in 1946 for their original case goods was available. These plywood sliding doors were molded with circular indentations, which gave them a cared-for appearance and increased the wood’s durability and resistance to warping.
    </p>

    <p>Of all of the Eames designs, they provide the most obvious example of the benefits of standardized parts. The same parts could be used to make several different kinds of storage units, and the cost savings for the manufacture meant lower prices to the consumer. The storage units and the desks were sold to consumers fully assembled, in configurations ordained by Charles and Ray Eames.</p>

        <h4>Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman</h4>
        <p>The iconic Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman, originally released in 1956, began with the designers' desire to
          create a chair with "the warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman's mitt." The result embodies what
          it really means to relax. In continuous production since its introduction, this authentic contemporary lounge
          chair is assembled by hand to ensure the highest level of quality and craftsmanship. Available in a range of
          wood finishes, upholsteries, and sizes, the Eames Lounge Chair and Ottoman remains ever more relevant today as
          it was in 1956.</p>

        <h4>Eames Desk Unit</h4>
        <p>In 1949, Charles and Ray Eames developed an innovative system of freestanding, multifunctional shelves and
          desks. Similar to the simultaneously constructed Eames House, these designs adhered to the principles of
          industrial production: the Eames Storage Units (ESU) and the Eames Desk Unit (EDU).</p>
        <p>In collaboration with the Eames Office and Dutch designer Hella Jongerius, a carefully defined new colour
          scheme was chosen to give the EDU a fresh and contemporary look while still celebrating the spirit of the
          1940s and '50s. With its eye-catching combination of coloured panels, the EDU desk adds a cheerful and
          inviting accent to the home office. The panels also function as a modesty shield and partially enclose the two
          storage compartments. The metal support frame is height-adjustable to accommodate uneven floors.</p>

        <h4>901</h4>
        <p>In 1943, the Eames Office moved into a prominent new Venice location on 901 W. Washington Boulevard, famously
          known as ‘901’. Here, they investigated new molded plywood applications that included glider shells, chairs,
          children’s furniture and animals, and eventually the LCW (Lounge Chair Wood) in 1946. The industrious walls of
          901 served as home to the Eames Office for nearly four decades. Its 20,000 square feet enclosed a circus-like
          workspace: a playful menagerie—filled with exhibition signage, furniture prototypes, desks, vintage toys, a
          research library, a film screening room, a pet octopus, and flexible walls—glued together with a work ethic of
          tightrope-walking precision.
          Their belief that everyday objects can both define and provide meaning makes them one of the most enduring
          creative forces of the 20th century. They predicted the future even if they couldn’t describe it. </p>
        <p>
          At 901, Charles and Ray and the Eames Office team created furniture classics like the Eames Lounge Chair and
          Ottoman, designed the Eames House, and made the still groundbreaking scientific film, Powers of Ten. They even
          held key consulting positions for major corporations such as IBM. The Eames Office made significant
          contributions to architecture, furniture design, industrial design, manufacturing, and photographic arts,
          until Ray’s death in 1988.

        <h4>Eames Shell Chairs</h4>

        <p>The Fiberglass Chairs were launched on the market in 1950, introducing a new furniture typology that has
          since become widespread: the multifunctional chair whose shell can be combined with a variety of bases to
          serve different purposes. In response to the enormous popularity of the chair, the choice of bases and colours
          was subsequently expanded. Over the course of the following decade, the Fiberglass Chairs became one of the
          best known furniture designs of the twentieth century.

        <p>Vitra manufactures the Fiberglass Side Chairs and Fiberglass Armchairs by Charles and Ray Eames in some of
          the early original colours. The fibreglass shells are characterised by their lively visual appeal, which is
          much-prized today. Fibreglass owes its charm to an irregular surface, which appears almost like a natural
          material thanks to its clearly visible fibres. The versions with a polypropylene shell – the Eames Plastic
          Chairs– also remain available. Together the two chair groups form an extensive family, enabling countless
          variations of the classic Eames design, with a suitable version for almost every taste and purpose.</p>

        <p>Charles and Ray attached great importance to the use of colours – as fibreglass had previously only existed
          in a colourless version. They consequently spent many days in the factory, mixing hues for countless
          prototypes in their efforts to create colours that best accentuated the organic shape of both shell forms –
          with and without armrests – in a range of coordinated shades. The first colours developed by the Eameses were
          greige (a mix of grey and beige), elephant hide grey (to which Charles was referring when he said 'What I
          really want is a black with feeling') and the slightly transparent tone parchment. Sea foam green, navy blue,
          yellow, dark and light ochre, and also red followed shortly after in the very early days of production.

        <p>Charles Eames famously said, “The role of the designer is that of a very good, thoughtful host anticipating
          the needs of his guests.” The Molded Shell Chairs fulfill a universal response to what one wants in a chair:
          so that it could fit every body and any context, a chair that would be equally at home in a museum, living
          room or business.</p>
        <p>The Eames Molded Plastic Dowel-Leg Armchair is back in ten archival colors and plenty of options to
          customize, including upholstery. This chair, first designed in 1950, continues to be extremely versatile and
          durable. Making it the perfect fit for an office lounge, living room or children’s room.</p>

        <p>Charles and Ray designed this lounge chair for The Museum of Modern Art’s 1948 “International Competition for
          Low-Cost Furniture Design.” Its name references both its function as well as Gaston Lachaise’s Floating Figure
          sculpture, whose shape the Eameses thought would fit the chair perfectly. </p>
